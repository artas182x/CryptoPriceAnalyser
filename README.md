# Cryptocurrency price analyser


This is simple cryptocurrency price analyser created for Numerical Methods subject on my technical university. It takes file in CSV format (example in repo) and caluclate signals where to buy or sell and produces charts. It uses own simple strategy and EMA or HMA as a indicator.  HMA can be enabled by changing using HMA variable.
